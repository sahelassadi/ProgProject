## 3- Expected Output 

1. Customer
* View Account Details:
If the customer wishes to view his account details, he will need to enter only his full name, and his Social Insurance Number (SIN). Once entered, the customer will have to select which card he would like to view. Then, he will be able to view his account type, balance, loan interest rates and transaction history.
* Update Customer Details:
If the customer wishes to update his personal details, he will need to enter his full name and his Social Insurance Number (SIN). After that, he can change any of the personal details: date of birth, email address or home address.
* Deposit and Withdrawal amount:
For depositing and withdrawing an amount of money, the customer will need to enter his full name and SIN. After that, he will need to select in which account he would like to do either operation. Then the money will be deposited or withdrawed. There could be a message to say if there isn't enough money in the account, the amount will not be able to be withdrawn.
